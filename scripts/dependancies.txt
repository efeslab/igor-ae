The following packages are needed to run the scripts on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

$ sudo apt-get install build-essential
$ sudo apt install python-numpy
$ sudo apt install python2-dev libfreetype-dev libpng-dev
$ sudo apt install python-six python-pyparsing python-dateutil

It is also necessary to install Matplotlib 1.4, which is the latest version of
Matplotlib compatible with Python2. It will be installed to the user's home
directory, and will not interfere with the Matplotlib3 system packages. It can
be removed at any time by deleting the right directories.
   
[1] Download the Matplotlib2 source tarball.

    https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/releases/tag/v1.4.1

[2] Next, navigate to the extracted matplotlib-1.4.1 directory and replace the
    "http" with "https" in the "distribute_setup.py" script.

    DEFAULT_URL = "https://pypi.python.org/..."

[3] Next, run the following. Matplotlib 1.4 will be installed to
    "~/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/matplot...".

    $ python2 setup.py build
    $ python2 setup.py install --user

Matplotlib can now be imported into Python2 scripts.
