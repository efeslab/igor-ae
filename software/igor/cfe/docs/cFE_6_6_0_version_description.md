#  FSW Version Description

## Purpose and Summary

The purpose of this build is to continue to refine the cFE FSW product. This build provides various bug
fixes, as well as, new features and enhancements including:

+   Symmetric Multi-Processor (SMP) updates to ensure multi-thread saftey when writing to the system log
    and performing internal time updates and time services

+   New platform configuration to expand the Consultative Committee for Spacecraft Data Systems
    (CCSDS) APID name space beyond 2^11. Using the CCSDS Version 2 Spacecraft Onboard Interface
    Services Area (SOIS) standard, this new configuration uses the extensions to the CCSDS Space
    Packet secondary header containing APID qualifier and subsystem ID information.  The CCSDS
    Primary Header APID continues to be used as a unique system-wide message identifier.
    Configurable macros are then utilized to generate a unique mission wide message identifier
    from the APID qualifier, command/telemetry bit, subsystem ID, and APID information with the
    CCSDS headers.  This new configuration addresses several issues including:

    - Difficulties allocating and managing the limited number of APIDs during development
    - Insufficient number of APIDs for large systems
    - APID allocations for formation flying, distributed systems, multi-core, and partitioned systems
    - Loss of spacecraft and subsystem identifying information as packets traverse the network stacks

+   ES Memory Pool updates to guarantee buffers allocated from a pool meet the target CPU architecture
    requirements for the largest C99 data types (long long int, long double, and void*). Additionally,
    this introduces a new platform configuration option to increase the alignment to greater value, as
    this can yield performance improvements on some architectures.

+   CCSDS Electronic Data Sheets (EDS) support.  An EDS is a formal machine readable (XML) specification
    of interfaces for both hardware and software components.  The primary use cases are to warrent
    Exchange of unambiguous interface definitions in a standard format between organizations (As CCSDS
    is an international standards body, organizations includes other international agencies, and
    industry partners);
    Automatic generation of interface code, system models, system tests, and mission operational databases;
    and Run-time support for Plug-and-Play systems.
    EDS updates in this release include:

    - SOIS EDS XML files for each of the core applications (ES, EVS, SB, FS, TBL, and TIME)
    - Adoption and implementation of a consistent naming convention for all identifiers.  This serves as a
      prerequisite to using any sort of generated header files or source code from the EDS XML files.
    - Ensuring library loads are not duplicates.  The lack of a runtime ID becomes important/relevant if a
      loadable library contains an EDS that needs to be registered in the local EDS table for other apps to use.
    - Message dispatch consistency across the core applications.   Every interface message defined in the
      external interface (be it EDS or otherwise) now has a separate dedicated handler function. This
      includes no-op and send housekeeping commands.  The message handler functions all have a similar
      prototype:

      int32 MessageHandler(const MessageType_t *data);

+   Actual short format event message

+   Removal of compile time upper bound checks on platform configuration parameters

+   Adoption and implementation of a consistent naming convention for all mission and platform configuration
    parameters

+   New platform configuration to define the length of time (in milliseconds) ES will delay when sending shell
    command packets over the software bus

+   Moving Performance ID definitions from private to public header files

+   Adding missing command length verification for SB and TIME applications

+   Adding new Software Bus API to control whether the app publishing a message receives the message in its
    own pipe. 

There were no changes to existing APIs made in this build however, there were two changes that result in
expected compiler warnings building with the latest release of the OSAL, Version 4.2.1:

1. cfe/fsw/cfe-core/src/es/cfe_es_shell.c: In function ‘CFE_ES_ShellOutputCommand’: line 98: warning: passing
   argument 1 of ‘OS_ShellOutputToFile’ discards qualifiers from pointer target type.
   osal/src/os/inc/osapi-os-filesys.h:439: note: expected ‘char *’ but argument is of type ‘const char *’

2. cfe/fsw/cfe-core/src/tbl/cfe_tbl_task_cmds.c: In function ‘CFE_TBL_DumpToFile’: line 784: warning: passing
   argument 2 of ‘OS_write’ discards qualifiers from pointer target type.
   osal/src/os/inc/osapi-os-filesys.h:280: note: expected ‘void *’ but argument is of type ‘const void *’

These warnings will be resolved in a future release of the OSAL.

In addition, backward compatibility is not supported with versions of the OSAL library older than 4.2.0 and
versions of the PSP library older than 1.3.0.  Additional release notes may be found at:

https://babelfish.arc.nasa.gov/trac/cfs_cfe/wiki/ReleaseNotes

These release notes are also include in the /docs directory where this VDD is located.

Unit testing has been completed and baselined on cFE build 6.6.0 using
the updated cFE test suite. Results are included in the release package
in the “Results” directories included under:

/fsw/cfe-core/unit-test/

Regression testing was performed on cFE 6.6.0 on a PPC/mcp750 running
VxWorks 6.9. Results are included in the release package under:

/test-and-ground/test-review-packages/Results

Functional testing was performed on a variety of platforms. See section
[Tested Platforms] for a listing of the platforms on which functional 
testing was performed.

There are some outstanding issues being investigated. Resolutions to
these issues may require a new release. The project CCB and community
inputs will determine which Trac Tickets to include in the next release.

## New/Changed functionality in this version

Table 1.2-1 identifies new FSW functionality that has been implemented
and is integrated into this FSW version and the Trac tickets associated
with these changes.

## Tested Platforms

Since the cFE uses the Operating System Abstraction Layer (OSAL),
multiple operating systems are supported. Build Testing of cFE Build
6.6.0 has been done on a PPC/mcp750 using the RTOS and compiler
specified in Table 1.4-1 above. In addition, cFE Build 6.6.0 has been
functionally tested with the hardware/software platforms listed in
Table 1.5-1 below (build test platform is included for completeness).
